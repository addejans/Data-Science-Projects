## k-NN Algorithm

In this project we explore the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. We explore its pitfalls and some interesting cases of when it works best.  We also explore implementing the algorithm using pairwise_distances from sklearn to increase the algorithms speed.  MNIST data set used.

## Naive Bayes & Bayes Classifiers

We examine Bayes vs Naive Bayes methods.  We see how Bayes will outperform Naive Bayes. MNIST data set used.

## Decision Tree Classifier

We examine the implementation of decision tree classifiers. The crux of the algorithm to make essentially an arbitrary number of nested if-statements. MNIST data set used.

## Perceptrons

Perceptron for MNIST and XOR.

## Regression using k-NN and Decision Trees via scikit-learn

Attempt to see functionality of scikit-learn and using weighted k-NN to smooth our model.
